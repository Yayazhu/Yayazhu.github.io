16 personalities - "Virtuoso" (ISTP)

This is so me!

- Virtuosos find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before. 
- While their mechanical tendencies can make them appear simple at a glance, Virtuosos are actually quite enigmatic. Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but unble to stay focused on formal studies, Virtuoso personalities can be a challenge to predict, even by their friends and loved ones. Virtuosos can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions. (OMG,so true, scary!)
- Virtuosos' decisions stem from a sense of practical realism, and at their heart is a strong sense of direct fairness, a "do unto others" attitude, which really helps to explain many of Virtuosos'puzzling traits. Instead of being overly cautious though, avoiding stepping on toes in order to avoid having their toes stepped on, Virtuosos are likely to go too far, accepting likewise retaliation, good or bad, as fair play. 
- Finding an environment where they can work with good friends who understand their style and unpredictability, combining their creativity, sense of humor and hands-on approach to build practical solutions and things, will give Virtuosos many happy years of building useful boxes - and admiring them from the outside. 


Virtuoso strengths and weaknesses

Strengths
- Optimistic and energetic
- Creative and practical: Virtuosos are very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, and crafts. Novel ideas come easily, and they love using their hands to put them into action. 
- Spontaneous and rational
- Know how to prioritize
- Great in a Crisis: with all this hands-on creativity and spontaneity, it's no wonder that Virtuosos are naturals in crisis situations. People with this personality type usually enjoy a little physical risk, and they aren't afraid to get their hands dirty when the situation calls for it. 
- Relaxed: through all this, Virtuosos are able to stay quite relaxed. They live in the moment and go with the flow, refusing to worry too much about the future. 

Weaknesses
- Stuborn: as easily as Virtuosos go with the flow, they can also ignore it entirely, and usually move in another direction with little apology or sensitivity. If someone tries to change Virtosos'habits, lifestyle or ideas through criticism, they can become quite blunt in their irritation. 
- Insensitive: use logic, and even when they try to meet others halfway with empathy and emotional sensitivity, it rarely seems to quite come out right, if anything is even said at all. 
- Private and Reserved: Virtuoso personalities are notoriously difficult to get to know. They are true introverts, keeping their personal matters to themselves, and often just prefer silence to small talk. 
- Easily bored: Virtuosos enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent tinkerers, but much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things long-term. Once something is understood, Virtuosos tend to simply move on to something new and more interesting. 
- Dislike commitment: long-term commitments are particularly onerous for Virtuosos. They prefer to take things day-by-day, and the feeling of being locked into something for a long time is downright oppressive. This can be a particular challenge in Virtuosos'romantic relationships. 
- Risky Behavior: this stubbornness, difficulty with others'emotions, focus on the moment, and easy boredom can lead to unnecessary and unhelpful boundary-pushing, just for fun. Virtuosos have been known to escalate conflict and danger just to see where it goes, something that can have disastrous consequences for everyone around if they lose control of the situation. (Now some of past behaviors make sense to me; unconsiously sometimes)


Career interests

The Virtuoso personality type is probably the hardest to pin down in many aspects of life, but especially in their careers. Virtuosos thrive on diversity and unpredictability, on wondering 'what's next' every morning. This makes Virtuosos one of the most mysterious personality types, but also one of the most versatile in the professional world. 

Virtuosos are born problem-solvers with an unwavering focus on practical solutions. No other type s quite as fascinated by how things work, how tools can be used, and how facts can be put together to create immediate and satisfying results. This combination of curiosity and hands-on vigor make people with the Virtuoso personality type excellent mechanics, engineers, graphic designers, and forensic sicentists. 

"Practical" is the word of the day. But it's not the practicality of routine administration that Virtuosos crave - they need variety and action, perhaps even a little adrenaline in their work. Highly structured environments leave Virtuoso personalities bored and tired. Jobs that focus on crisis response, such as firefighters, paramedicals, detectives, pilots and police officers seem made for Virtuosos. 

Perhaps most important to Virtuosos though, is the feeling that they aren't stuck. The freedom to wander, the freedom to declare their own schedules, their own responsibilities, their own environments - nearly every other consideration pales by comparison to the need to avoid inflexible commitments and stodgy colleagues. While this can be a significant hurdle to overcome in traditional employment, it is the chiefest allure of entrepreneurship.

Nearly any creative or constructive skill or interest can be offered on a freelance basis or on a business-owner's own terms, be it blogger, systems analyst, athlete or driver. Virtuosos need to face down their weak long-term planning abilities and preference for instant results in order to make this path work, but livelihoods can be made selling bits and crafts in their free time. It's also possible to find more traditional work to satisfy these needs, and forest ranger is a sought-after line of work for many Virtuosos. 

Virtuosos have a natural skill with troubleshooting, a relaxed, self-confident nature and a results-oriented focus. People with this personality type understand that risk equals reward, and as long as they can use that understanding with maturity, rather than just kicking the ant's nest whenever they get bored, they are highly desirable in any dynamic field or environment. 


Workplace habbits

When it comes to the workplace, Virtuosos'top requirement is often a sense of unpredictability and excitement. This quality makes Virtuoso personalities'personal relationships challenging enough, even among close friends and immediate family - for those they've only come to know in a professional environment, it can be downright frustrating. 

Of course, this all comes down to knowing what makes them tick. With a little space and a hands-on problem to solve, Virtuosos can be some of the most productive people around. As with anyone, forcing people with the Virtuoso personality type into a mold that doesn't fit just doesn't work. Recognizing their unique perspective and gifts can lead to extraordinary results. 

As subordinates, what Virtuosos crave most is a little wigge room. Relaxed and easy-going, people with the Virtuoso personality type are happy to stick around with surprising loyalty, as long as their employers and managers don't try to force them to commit to anything that can't be undone the next day. Strict rules, guidelines and formal agreements make Virtuosos feel cramped and bored. If their habits or methods come under criticism or are forced to change, Virtuosos can also be surprisingly mulish. 

Virtuosos are often much more liked by their colleagues than they would expect. Quiet and reserved, people with this personality type usually need a little physical space, but at the same time, enjoy peeking in on others'work to see if there's anything interesting going on. Not naturally emotional or empathetic, Virtuosos have a blunt way of communicating that can lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings. Virtuosos have a great sense of humor, if sometimes a little risque, and not only resistant to workplace conflicts, but are great at defusing them with a well-placed joke that puts it all into perspective.
